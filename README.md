React Comment Box
=================

Comment box like the one you see in facebook, google and other modern sites with a comment box.

Uses textarea for getting the input but overlays a div right on top of the textarea, which takes care of stying different parts of the text.

Development -

```
npm install
node devServer
// open localhost:3000 in your favorite browser
```
